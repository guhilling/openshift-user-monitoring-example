# openshift-user-monitoring-example

Before adding the resources enable user workload monitoring by configuring cluster-monitoring-config. This will depend on your version. So it's probably best to check the docs:

* 4.9: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.html
* 4.5: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/monitoring/monitoring-your-own-services.html#enabling-monitoring-of-your-own-services_monitoring-your-own-services
